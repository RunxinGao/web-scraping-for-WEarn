This is an event that continues on The Year of Personal Purpose but the content is beneficial even if this is your first event.Mary Burke BIOMary Burke founded Building Brave to inspire and empower women in living their best lives. She grew up wanting a career in business, just like her dad Dick Burke, founder of Trek Bicycles. After achieving success in the private sector, Maryës life took an unlikely turn. In 2014 she launched a campaign to become Governor of Wisconsin, and made history becoming the first woman to win the nomination for Governor of Wisconsin from a major party. Today Mary works as a social entrepreneur and an advocate for women. Her leadership spans private, public and nonprofit sectors, with positions such as Director of European Operations for Trek Bicycle, and Wisconsinës Secretary of Commerce. Mary earned her BS in Business Administration at Georgetown University and her MBA from Harvard University.Speaking topic: How Women Power UpDiscovering the power of community profoundly changed Maryës journey. Her 2014 run for Governor--with its daily onslaught of judging, criticism and attacks--threatened to destroy her. Instead, thanks to a tremendous support community, Mary unlocked her potential and discovered a version of herself she had never imagined, overcoming both self-doubt and failure. She founded Building Brave with a mission to ensure that every woman has access to a supportive community and discovers the best version of herself.Thank you to our generous sponsor:","Wed, August 28, 2019, 7:30 AM ‚Äì 9:30 AM CDT, ",Madison Networking,"J.H.

Harambee Village seeks to lower black infant mortality by providing specialized care to all mothers, especially women of color, and by using grassroots connections and community partnerships to offer a variety of equitable resources.Loka Initiative, which is housed within the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, supports faith-led environmental efforts locally and around the world through collaborations with faith leaders and religious institutions on environmental protection, sustainable development and global health issues. Dekila Chungyalpa, director of the Loka Initiative, organized a global conference last month and pushed for inclusion of indigenous women and Wisconsin tribal leaders at this worldwide conference. Maydm is a local nonprofit that focuses on getting young women and students of color engaged in the STEM fields. Winnie Karanja, founder and executive director of Maydm, started the organization because women of color are vastly underrepresented in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. So efforts by Madym ‚Äî driven by Karanja ‚Äî are vital in providing a path for the organizationës students to become professionals of color in the STEM fields.Shiva Bidar is chief diversity officer at UW Health and president of the Madison Common Council. Chosen as an M List recipient by Madison365, Bidar has influenced both UW Health and the city of Madison to get money into the hands of organizations that are doing good work.Annik Dupaty is director of events and volunteers at the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art.

Coupled with an exhilarating guitar talent that transcends mere acoustic playing to replicate a whole band, Champagne is just magical (themusic.com.au) The story goes that the young Australian singer, songwriter and one-of-a-kind guitar virtuoso first picked up his instrument of choice as a five-year-old following in the footsteps of a musical father. He began writing songs at 12, training classically throughout his teens and performing solo wherever he could, honing his craft and developing what would become the dynamite live show that he is renowned for today. At 18 he left school, turned professional and hit the road. The next five years saw him traversing North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand and of course, his homeland Australia playing such festivals as Vancouver and Mariposa Folk (Canada), Belgiumës Labadoux Festival and Australiaës Woodford, Falls Festival, Port Fairy Folk Festival and the legendary Byron Bay Bluesfest.

In many instances, guests are seated with the performers and don't even realize it until they die...the performers, that is!

At the end of the night, prizes are awarded to the Top Sleuth who solves the crime.The Dinner Detective performs at The DoubleTree by Hilton Madison.

But the problem is, how do you meet them in the first place? Sure there are ways--bars, blind dates, dating services, online, etc. But they all have their disadvantages and they take time...lots of it. What fun is it to wait around for someone to talk to you in a bar or when you're out and about? What fun is it to risk rejection over and over again striking up conversations with people you don't even know are single? What if the conversation goes well, what about the awkwardness afterwards with asking for phone numbers? With Madison Pre-Dating, you meet up to 12 (and sometimes more) single professionals in less than 2 hours. Think of it as a series of ""facilitated introductions"" just like when you go to a party with a good host. Afterwards, if there's interest (you discreetly circle on your interest sheet who you would like to hear from again), you'll get an email with links to contact your ""mutual matches"". There's no pressure, no rejection, no embarrassment and no games, just fun! Try it and you'll see for yourself.

Christian Zionism‚Äîa set of theological arguments and political movement for supporting Israel‚Äîis not just a political issue. It also touches on some of the core questions of Christian identity: who are Godës chosen people? What is the relationship between Judaism and Christianity? How should Christians respond to the Holocaust? The modern Christian Zionist movement emerged after World War II with distinct answers to these questions that remain influential today.

Disseminating this water data and accompanying science is just as critical as producing it; however, traditional science products are often overlooked by general audiences even though they resonate with technical ones.Enter #dataviz. Data visualizations present an opportunity to innovate and transform the ways in which USGS shares water science through a combination of engaging displays of data, captivating design, and compelling science insights. This talk will share examples and describe the creation of these non-traditional science products which are intended for public consumption.ABOUT THE SPEAKERLindsay Platt is a Water Data Scientist for the Integrated Information Dissemination Division within the Water Mission Area at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). She holds a Bachelor's degree in Biological Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech, but before embarking on a traditional engineering career path, she found a passion for writing code to conduct data analyses (first in MATLAB and then in R).Now, as a data scientist with the USGS, her primary role is to distill large or complex water data into meaningful insights through reproducible science and innovative data visualizations. She also leads the USGS R training program, which teaches other USGS scientists how to wield the power of scientific computing to create their own reproducible workflows.DETAILSWe'll have socializing and networking from 5:30pm to 6pm; you're welcome to arrive anytime in that half hour. Lindsay's presentation will begin at 6pm.The State Street Capitol Parking Ramp is next door to the building; Overture Center Garage is a few blocks away.Bus lines that come nearby: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #11, #12, #14, #15, #19, #27, #29, #37, #47, #56, #57, #58, #70, #71, #72, #75Bunker is wheelchair accessible.","Wed, October 16, 2019, 5:30 PM ‚Äì 7:30 PM CDT, ",Madison Seminars,"Bunker , 202 State Street , ##300 , Madison, WI 53703 , ", Codecinella

Wisconsin ranks worst nationally in the disparities between race among children in recent studies. 
Teachers have come together with intention to begin the necessary work in combating these disparities, to commit to practicing anti-racism in the classroom, to provide tangible tools for facilitating conversations that address disparities, and to create a cohort of teachers who will break down the hierarchy of white supremacy that is the root cause of the achievement gap.
To that end, teachers are partnering with Nehemiah-Justified Anger, which just finished its fourth year of Black History for a New Day. This 9-week course has produced hundreds of allies and activists in Madison, who take action, support the mission of Justified Anger and the greater community.  
We are bringing the success of the course to a one-day intensive seminar for teachers, using the Justified Anger model.  Nehemiah staff will facilitate a lecture, panel discussions, and facilitated small discussion groups for up to 250 teachers, to address the incomplete integration of schools, and the ways in which this has been a severe detriment to African American students.  Teachers will gain a broader understanding of institutional factors perpetuating disparities. They will hear from panelists with lived experience, who will challenge them to become educational advocates for racial equity. The seminar will inspire teachers to register for the next Justified Anger History Class, and delve further into the work of reducing racial disparities and bringing about healing.

Over time many people would attempt to weaponize these facts against him, yet Rustin remained true to his convictions, and his wisdom and clarity would ultimately be valued by many of those same people and institutions. This brief but comprehensive biography, written with the help of Rustinës longtime partner, Naegle, and featuring stunning archival photographs, covers the legacy of a man who utilized the roots of his Quaker faith to uplift movements throughout the world. In clear prose with informative sidebars that provide important context, it follows Rustin from his pacifist beginnings to his work mentoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his later years traveling the world to support the rights of refugees. In todayës political landscape, this volume is a lesson in the courage to live according to oneës truth and the dedication it takes to create a better world.","Tue, August 27, 2019, 7:00 PM ‚Äì 8:00 PM CDT, ",Madison Seminars,"Mystery to Me , 1863 Monroe Street , Madison, WI 53711 , ", Mystery to Me

How did childhood affect your adult experiences and perceptions? In what ways has your Christian faith been connected to or disconnected from your experience of the outdoors?Behold the Earth is an aesthetically-oriented, music-rich documentary that explores Americaës divorce from the outdoors through conversations with highly regarded scientists like E. O. Wilson, Cal DeWitt, and Theo Colborn, as well as a rising generation of creation-care advocates within the American Christian community. These biographical narratives challenge viewers of the film to reckon with the church's role in environmental stewardship, to reflect on their own faithfulness in this regard, and, ultimately, to restore our capacity for wonder.Dr. Rick Lindroth, UW-Madison Professor of Ecology, will set the stage for this two-hour event, which includes a one-hour film screening, followed by time for personal reflection and table discussion. ABOUT THE FILM DIRECTORDavid Conover, film director and conservationist, began work on this bold film twelve years ago, as an inquiry into Americaës divorce from the outdoors, before-and-after the arrival of those known as the digital natives. Conover is neither a scientist nor a Christian, but demonstrates great insight with respect to both. Some of the talented field staff who helped to capture the spectacular natural sequences in his series Sunrise Earth and Big Picture Earth contribute significantly to Behold the Earth. With Rhiannon Giddens and Tim Eriksen, four-time Grammy winning musician Dirk Powell arranges traditional American tunes and hymns.ABOUT THE PROGRAM HOSTRick Lindroth is a Vilas Distinguished Achievement & Sorenson Professor and recent Associate Dean for Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He received his Ph.D. in ecology at the University of Illinois-Urbana, and has spent his entire academic career at UW-Madison. Rickës research focuses on evolutionary ecology and global change ecology. He has been a Fulbright Fellow and is a Fellow of the Ecological Society of America, the Entomological Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Rick has served on the editorial boards for multiple scientific journals and on grant panels for NSF and USDA. He is a member of the BioLogos Voices speakers bureau. Rick and his wife Nancy are parents to two extraordinary daughters and grandparents to two grandsons and one granddaughter. They have served in numerous ministry roles at Blackhawk Church in Madison. Rick enjoys outdoor hobbies aided and abetted by carbon fiber technology: cycling, fly fishing, and paddling.","Mon, October 14, 2019, 7:00 PM ‚Äì 9:00 PM CDT, ",Madison Screenings,"Upper House , 365 East Campus Mall , Suite 200 , Madison, WI 53715 , ", Upper House

The author John describes his vision of Jesus Christ standing amidst seven golden lampstands, which represent the seven churches in Asia Minor to whom the book is written. From his place among the lampstands, Jesus admonished, commended, and made promises to each of the seven churches. Leslie's art installation of seven woolen garments, entitled Hold Fast, reflects each of the seven churches and communicates a portion of their story, warning and welcoming us into a larger narrative.

But the problem is, how do you meet them in the first place? Sure there are ways--bars, blind dates, dating services, online, etc. But they all have their disadvantages and they take time...lots of it. What fun is it to wait around for someone to talk to you in a bar or when you're out and about? What fun is it to risk rejection over and over again striking up conversations with people you don't even know are single? What if the conversation goes well, what about the awkwardness afterwards with asking for phone numbers? With Madison Pre-Dating, you meet up to 12 (and sometimes more) single professionals in less than 2 hours. Think of it as a series of ""facilitated introductions"" just like when you go to a party with a good host. Afterwards, if there's interest (you discreetly circle on your interest sheet who you would like to hear from again), you'll get an email with links to contact your ""mutual matches"". There's no pressure, no rejection, no embarrassment and no games, just fun! Try it and you'll see for yourself.

Growing up in what was a conservative rural town, he got his first taste of liberal activism at the University of Wisconsin in the 1960s, became the first executive director of the National Football League Players' Union, led two spirited campaigns against Bob Kasten and Tommy Thompson, and eventually cofounded the Fighting Bob Fest. Shortly before he died, Garvey expressed his views on everything in a series of detailed interviews with journalist Rob Zaleski. In his trademark witty, blunt, and often abrasive style, he offered his impressions of the political climate, worries about the environment, and Act 10 protests on Capitol Square. Garvey's candor during these conversations provides deeper insight into the personal highs and lows he experienced over his rich life. Diehard followers will fondly remember his energetic campaigns, but they may be surprised to learn of his long-simmering disappointment after those losses. Ever timely and meaningful, Garvey's words offer a path for how the Democratic Party, both within Wisconsin and nationally, can regain its soul. ROB ZALESKI is a freelance writer and award-winning columnist. He spent twenty-six years writing for The Capital Times in Madison.","Thu, September 19, 2019, 7:00 PM ‚Äì 8:00 PM CDT, ",Madison Seminars,"Mystery to Me , 1863 Monroe Street , Madison, WI 53711 , ", Mystery to Me

Over five years in the making, FAIL STATE investigates the for-profit college industry and the decades-long reports of student loan abuse within the sector. The filmës central thesis: aided by a cabal of politicians, nationwide disinvestment in public colleges and universities, and an unscrupulous desire to maximize profits at all costs, for-profit colleges have exploited millions of low-income and minority students, leaving them with worthless degrees and drowning in student loan debt. With echoes of the subprime mortgage crisis, director Alexander Shebanow traces the rise of the for-profit college industry in American higher education and uncovers a story that the Los Angeles Times calls ‚Äútruly eye-opening and crucial.‚ÄùThe film premiered to sold-out shows at DOC NYC, SXSW EDU, Cleveland International, and debuted on STARZ last December. Following the screening, the event organizers will host an illuminating panel discussion on protecting students and the American taxpayer from predatory colleges. The film's director and other special guests will be in attendance. General Admission tickets are for non-reserved, open seating. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and we recommend you arrive early to get a great seat.Please contact kate@nsldn.org if you have any questions.

What role did synagogues play in the Gospel narrative of Jesus' life and ministry? Despite the emphasis of recent scholarship on Jesus' Jewish heritage and the Jewish setting of the New Testament, synagogue studies have played next to no role in the historical study of Jesus. In effort to fill this void, Dr. Ryan has sought to open new avenues for interpretation and understanding of who Jesus was, as well as what he taught and how he lived, through a better understanding of one of the primary settings of Jesus' activities during his ministry: the synagogue.With extensive experience in the field, Dr. Ryan is one of the preeminent authorities on this crucial institution in the life of Jesus. His engaging and innovative research into the background of the New Testament provides new insights in an area of intense scholarly and public interest. In honor of International Archeology Day, and in partnership with the Madison Biblical Archeology Society and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Dr. Ryan will offer a scholarly lens through which to read the subtle and often unappreciated contexts of many of Jesusë teachings.  Jordan J. Ryan is Assistant Professor of New Testament at Wheaton College. He previously taught at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary. He is the author of The Role of the Synagogue in the Aims of Jesus (Fortress Press, 2017) and holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from McMaster University. His research has appeared in the Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus and Catholic Biblical Quarterly, among other journals.","Sat, October 19, 2019, 7:00 PM ‚Äì 8:30 PM CDT, ",Madison Seminars,"Upper House , 365 East Campus Mall , #200 , Madison, WI 53715 , ", Upper House

RSVP via this EventbriteStudent Defense, University of Wisconsin's La Follette School of Public Affairs, University of Wisconsin's Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education, One Wisconsin Now, and the American Constitution Society proudly present a free screening of FAIL STATE, an award-winning documentary executive produced by news legend Dan Rather. Over five years in the making, FAIL STATE investigates the for-profit college industry and the decades-long reports of student loan abuse within the sector. The filmës central thesis: aided by a cabal of politicians, nationwide disinvestment in public colleges and universities, and an unscrupulous desire to maximize profits at all costs, for-profit colleges have exploited millions of low-income and minority students, leaving them with worthless degrees and drowning in student loan debt. With echoes of the subprime mortgage crisis, director Alexander Shebanow traces the rise of the for-profit college industry in American higher education and uncovers a story that the Los Angeles Times calls ‚Äútruly eye-opening and crucial.‚ÄùThe film premiered to sold-out shows at DOC NYC, SXSW EDU, Cleveland International, and debuted on STARZ last December. Following the screening, the event organizers will host an illuminating panel discussion on protecting students and the American taxpayer from predatory colleges. The film's director and other special guests will be in attendance. General Admission tickets are for non-reserved, open seating. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and we recommend you arrive early to get a great seat.Please contact kate@nsldn.org if you have any questions.

Over five years in the making, FAIL STATE investigates the for-profit college industry and the decades-long reports of student loan abuse within the sector. The filmës central thesis: aided by a cabal of politicians, nationwide disinvestment in public colleges and universities, and an unscrupulous desire to maximize profits at all costs, for-profit colleges have exploited millions of low-income and minority students, leaving them with worthless degrees and drowning in student loan debt. With echoes of the subprime mortgage crisis, director Alexander Shebanow traces the rise of the for-profit college industry in American higher education and uncovers a story that the Los Angeles Times calls ‚Äútruly eye-opening and crucial.‚ÄùThe film premiered to sold-out shows at DOC NYC, SXSW EDU, Cleveland International, and debuted on STARZ last December. Following the screening, the event organizers will host an illuminating panel discussion on protecting students and the American taxpayer from predatory colleges. The film's director and other special guests will be in attendance. General Admission tickets are for non-reserved, open seating.

With that goal in mind, Leslie will present the dynamic writing process she has used as a writer and a teacher of writing that is both practical and inspiring, from accessing memory and mapping your story, to generating ideas and realizing a final draft.  Lunch will be provided. Space is limited to 25 participants.Leslie Leyland Fields is the author of twelve books, including The Wonder Years: 40 Women Over 40 on Aging, Faith, Beauty and Strength and Crossing the Waters: Following Jesus through the Storms, the Fish, the Doubt and the Seas, which won Christianity Today's 2017 Book Award in Christian Living. Her essays have appeared in Christianity Today, In Touch Magazine, Belief.net, The Atlantic, Orion, and Best Essays.

It's called ""LEVERAGE"" and we'll show you just how other people right here in Dane County are doing it every single day to grow their retirement accounts and pad their cash reserves without investing in the stock market.In this free informal talk, we're going to show you just how to do it.We're local real estate investors who've been using other investors money and offering a lucrative interest rate while protecting our private lenders with a mortgage and insurance since 2009 (not something you'd get from investing in stocks).In the process, we've paid LOTS of money to people just like you, who don't necessarily want to be landlords or own real estate but who love leveraging our expertise and seeing a return on their investment.Whether you're like some of our investors who've pulled out of the stock market and are sitting on cash, or you have a retirement account that isn't perfoming like you'd hoped...Or you're just curious about what we're doing, and wondering if it might be a better option for you in terms of risk and reward...... We're going to go through the entire process with you step-by-step so you can evaluate deals just like the banks do.We'll show you:We're even going to show you:We're not into sugar coating anything, we do this every day and absolutely know that real estate and private lending are not for everyone.But, if it's for you, we'd love to show you just how to make it happen and to do so with as much information as you'll need to make and informed decision.Not only that, but we'll feed you too!

We are simply gathering the natural talents and gifts we see in our community, and making it available. We believe in the magic that is created when we show up together and allow the energy that is created to embolden us. We provide meals, suggested activities, and prompts. But come as you are, and participate in whatever way you need.  We seek to specifically nourish our relationships with women in this space.  Your organizers experienced, like many of us, poor lessons in celebrating femininity.  May this gathering serve as a space to meet, connect, share, discuss, ask, sing, dance, and celebrate all that we are. Please see event image for featured offerings and activities. A complete schedule will be sent out to all attendees prior to arrival. WHO IS GATHERINGAfter much deliberation, we decided to host a women's only space.  We invite any female-identifying people to attend.  Our hope is to hold a space for all women, in all their beauty and power. Queer and trans friendly.

Also bring a yoga mat and anything else you use to feel comfortable (blocks, straps, bolsters, blankets) on a mat.

This yearës elegant outdoor dinner is scheduled for Saturday, August 17 and will be hosted by the Emmons Blaine Dairy Cattle Research Center, on the Arlington Ag Research Station in Arlington, Wis.Consumers and farmers come together at this event for a memorable dining experience, focused on each farmës dedication to animal care, environmental practices, and providing safe and pure food products consumed at family dinner tables throughout the year. This is a unique opportunity to discover Wisconsin agriculture through a unique on-farm culinary experience. Guests may explore the taste of Wisconsinës agricultural diversity from prestigious cheeses, meats, vegetables, and beyond.The eveningës creations will be prepared and presented by local chef and self-proclaimed farm kid, Tyler Sailsbery. Chef Sailsbery is the head chef and owner of The Black Sheep in Whitewater, Wis., where he works with local farmers to craft unique dishes, packed with fresh ingredients and divine flavors. Chef Tyler also works as the executive chef and general manager for Fin & Hooves, inside the Whitewater Country Club, which offers a casual and fun atmosphere.Located just 15 miles north of Madison, the Emmons Blaine Dairy Cattle Research Center is a premier dairy research and teaching facility in the U.S. and is part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The state-of-the-art freestall facility was built in 2008, which allows for completion of pen-based nutrition work, mammary and reproductive physiology research, calf growth studies, transition cow management projects, and individual animal intakes. The farm is located at W6723 Badger Lane, Arlington, WI 53911.‚ÄúWe are excited about the opportunity to share what we do here as a research facility,‚Äù says Jessica Cederquist, Dairy Herd Administrator for the Department of Dairy Science at UW ‚Äì Madison.  ‚ÄúWe hope that this event allows our guests to see that a dairy farm is so much more than just milking cows. Many people both from afar and locally, do not realize that the UW has a dairy herd, let alone understand the extensiveness of our program. We love sharing what ‚ÄúBucky‚Äù has to offer.‚ÄùThe Arlington Ag Research Station comes from a deep dairy heritage that began at UW-Madison, and today, has a prime focus on the future.‚ÄúThis facility is home to cutting edge research that is constantly impacting the future of the industry, and the lives of our consumers, neighbors, and colleagues alike. The UW is rich in history, built on the drive and passion for making a better tomorrow. We are about what is coming next, what is not yet known, what is the next big break, and what piece to the puzzle is under the next rock,‚Äù says Cederquist. ‚ÄúWhile most dairy farms share stories of their familyës generations, we share the work and progress of generations of scientists.‚ÄùProceeds from the Wisconsin Farm to Table dinner go towards a charity chosen by this yearës hosts. In 2018, our host farm, Darlington Ridge Farms chose to donate to Family Promise of Grant County and the Belmont Remarkable Angels.The sixth-annual Farm to Table dinner will incorporate a farm tour at 5:00 p.m., followed by a cheese reception and live music entertainment at 6:00 p.m., and conclude with a catered dinner complimented by a supplier stories program at 7:00 p.m.To secure dinner tickets and for more information, visit www.wifarmtotable.com, call event contact, Kari Kuehl, at (262) 203-4016, or email wifarmtotable@gmail.com. The event is open to the public and specifically influential people in the surrounding region that are interested in learning more about agriculture and where their food originates. The event is limited to the first 100 guests. Those interested are encouraged to purchase tickets early.Wisconsin Farm to Table is a non-profit event organization established in 2013 to offer an on-farm experience, with a farm tour, elegant dinner, and dialogue between those interested in agriculture and where their food originates. Money raised from annual event is donated to a local non-for-profit of the host farmës choice.","Sat, August 17, 2019, 5:00 PM ‚Äì 9:30 PM CDT, ",Other,"Emmons Blaine Dairy Cattle Research Center , W6723 Badger Lane , Arlington, WI 53911 , ", Wisconsin Farm to Table
